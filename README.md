# Study-of-different-types-of-image-moments-in-recognition-of-microscopic-images-of-parasitic-eggs
In our work, we have performed experiments to identify three different types of parasitic eggs in microscopic images of fecal samples of pigs using different types of image moments. For our experiment, we have extracted five different types of image moments as features from those images. We have used images of three different types of parasitic eggs, i.e., Ascaris, Necator, and Trichuris. We then implemented our experiments in an open-source platform Jupyter using Python. First, we convert the images of parasite eggs into grayscale then calculate the moments of each image and labeled them according to their respective class of parasite egg type. In order to find the effectiveness of each type of image moments, we performed classification of the extracted feature set or moments. For classification, we used classifier Support Vector Machine (SVM).
